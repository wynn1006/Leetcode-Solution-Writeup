Brute force
Simply using DFS to walk through all nodes in the tree from left to right.
During the traversal, add each node to the result list to it's corresponding level.
If the current level is not existed in the result list, it means this level wasn't visited yet, so add a new list to the end of the result list.
Time Complexity: O(aomunt of nodes)
Space Complexity: O(amount of nodes)
